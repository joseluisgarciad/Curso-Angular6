readme

This repository has a few templates for README files and some notes about which type of information you could write on them.
Prepare the content

Readme files are made for developers (including you), but also could be used for the final users. So while you are writing your readme files please consider a few things:

    What is about?
        Describe the content of your project or repository
        Explain things the users would have a hard time understanding right away
    What steps need to be taken?
        Do they need to install any software?
        Is there any hardware requirements or dependencies?
        After the installation, how they compile or run the code?
    Execution examples
        You could provide examples of execution with code and screenshots
